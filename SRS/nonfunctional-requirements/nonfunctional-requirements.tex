\chapter{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
$<$If there are performance requirements for the product under various
circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the
developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the
timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific
as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual
functional requirements or features.$>$

\section{Safety Requirements}
The drone shall take off and land by automated mechanisms to ensure ranger safety.
\newline
The drone shall keep a safe distance from the ranger at all times while in the air.
\newline
The drone shall ignore further commands and return to the landing pad if the battery falls below a certain level.
\newline
The drone shall return to the landing pad if it loses a connection to the ranger to prevent damage to the drone.
\newline

\section{Security Requirements}
The drone shall encrypt its stored data to ensure that if a drone is lost or stolen no sentitive information can be leaked.
\newline
The drone shall only accept commands from an authenticated entity to minimize the risk of hijacking or malicious actions, 
safety procedure will be followed in the event that the drone is unable to receive any commands after a set period (I.e. 30 seconds).
\newline
The ranger shall constantly be sending and receiving communication from the drone across a wireless signal,
therefore all transmitted information will require at least 256-bit encryption to ensure no senstive information is leaked to potential evildoers.
\newline

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
$<$ Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when possible.$>$
\subsection {Reliability}
\subsection {availability}
\subsection {Usability}


\section{Business Rules}
$<$List any operating principles about the product, such as which individuals or
roles can perform which functions under specific circumstances. These are not
functional requirements in themselves, but they may imply certain functional
requirements to enforce the rules.$>$
