\chapter{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
$<$If there are performance requirements for the product under various
circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the
developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the
timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific
as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual
functional requirements or features.$>$

\section{Safety Requirements}
The drone shall take off and land by automated mechanisms to ensure ranger safety.
The drone shall keep a safe distance from the ranger at all times while in the air.

\section{Security Requirements}
The drone shall not store any data and only relay it across systems to ensure that if a drone is lost or stolen no sentitive information can be leaked.
The drone shall only accept commands from an authenticated entity to minimize the risk of hijacking or malicious actions, 
security procedure will be followed in the event that the drone is unable to receive any commands after a set period (I.e. 30 seconds).
The ranger shall constantly be sending and receiving communication from the drone across a wireless signal, 
therefore all transmitted information will require at least 256-bit encryption to ensure no senstive information is leaked to potential evildoers.

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
$<$Specify any additional quality characteristics for the product that will be
important to either the customers or the developers. Some to consider are:
adaptability, availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability,
maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability,
and usability. Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when
possible. At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes,
such as ease of use over ease of learning.$>$

\section{Business Rules}
$<$List any operating principles about the product, such as which individuals or
roles can perform which functions under specific circumstances. These are not
functional requirements in themselves, but they may imply certain functional
requirements to enforce the rules.$>$
