\chapter{System Overview}

This document outlines how each subsystem can be operated independently, 
this is not a recommended way to use the system as it is designed to work in its entirety.

For the system to work entirely, follow the methods for setting up each subsystem and 
then follow the jetson and mobile application user manuals.
